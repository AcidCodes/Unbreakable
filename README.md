# Unbreakable
In this experience you become stranded in a barren wasteland made almost entirely of Bedrock with some Lava and Oil lakes sprinkled around. You will also find mystical temples which you scavenge your first resources from. You might also find yourself overrun by monsters as it is constantly night-time, so make yourself some shelter ASAP. After gathering your first resources you quickly find yourself using "Stolen Moments" to influence time in strange ways through which you get higher quality resources, including metals. After this you start making your own machines and getting more and more powerful, with goal being to harvest the power of the Bedrock to escape this place.

This Modpack focuses highly on tech and includes a few custom machines made to make progression less tedious, but also features some magic like Astral Sorcery, and the general progression involves you automating resources to make your own bedrock blocks to make a portal that allows you to escape. This Pack is very inspired by concepts like "SkyBlock", "StoneBlock" and anything similar. It also features a one of a kind mod for early-game resource generation called "Parachronology" which allows to use so-called "Moments" to transform blocks into other blocks, i.e. Wood to Petrified Wood(which is also a cobblestone substitute) and Stone to various Ores. Optional Quests that loosely guide you through the Pack are also included so that you won't get lost.


Thanks to Noobcrew for creating the original SkyBlock and Sunekaer for making Stoneblock, that inspired me and so many others.
Further Thanks to Hyperpix for providing the template for the Logo.
